          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <h3>myFlix is a web app, developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), that provides
            users
            with access to information about
            movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to create an account, update their personal data, and create a
            list of favorite movies.</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
          <h3>myFlix was a project I built as part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to
            demonstrate
            my abilities in full-stack JavaScript development.</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <h3>The objective of the project was to have an ambitious full-stack project that I can add to my professional
            portfolio.</h3>

          <h2>Server-Side Approach</h2>
          <h3>I built a REST API that allows users to create a profile and compile a list of their favorite movies. Each
            movie will
            contain a biography of the director as well as information about the genre. Users can update their profile
            as
            well as add and delete movies. I built this API using Node.js and Express and it interacts with a
            non-relational database(MongoDB)
          </h3>
          <h3>To test the API, I used Postman. I also included user authentication and authorization code in the form of
            basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication.</h3>

          <h3>After completing the API, I started to build the interface users would need when making requests to, and
            receiving responses from, the server-side. This single-page, responsive application (SPA) features routing,
            rich interactions, several interface
            views, and a polished user experience with React. It is developed with React
            and React-Redux. It provides several interface views, including, but not limited to, a main view (shows a
            list of all movies), single movie view (shows data about a single movie and allows users to add the movie to
            their list of favorites), a login view, a registration view and a profile view (where users can update their
            user data and list of favorites).</h3>

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <h3>This project provided me with a wonderful set of challenges. I enjoyed building the API and working with
            database structures and developing an understanding of how the front end and back end work together.
            Developing the client-side, it
            took me a while to understand how React and Redux work and how to achieve the desired results.</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Duration</h2>
          <h3>The development of the client-side took me a bit longer than I would have thought. In addition to the time
            it took to understand how React and React Redux work, I also had to deal with some newly updated
            dependencies that did not function as I expected. I was able to take advantage of this to hone my skills in
            reading documentation.</h3>
